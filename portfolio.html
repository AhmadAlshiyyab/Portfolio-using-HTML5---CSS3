                      <p>Hi there, I'm Ahmad Alshiyyab , and I'm a programmer. I have always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it offers. My passion for programming began when I was young, and I started learning basic programming concepts in school. As I continued to learn more about programming, I realized that I wanted to pursue it as a career.

                        Over the years, I've developed a wide range of skills in different programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy working on challenging projects and finding creative solutions to complex problems. I believe that good programming requires a combination of technical expertise, critical thinking, and strong communication skills</p>
